_Version 1.1_

The Open Design states what "open" means for knowledge, supporting a strong shared resource that anyone can join, and ensuring that things work well together.

**Summary:** _Design that is licenced as **Open Design License 1.1** is accessible to anyone who is able to get, use, change, and share it - as long as it is kept track of, not redistributed in the same way and available to everyone._

This essential meaning matches that of “open” with respect to software as in the [Open Source Definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Source_Definition) and is synonymous with “free” or “libre” as in the [Free Software Definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Free_Software_Definition) and [Definition of Free Cultural Works](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition_of_Free_Cultural_Works).

The term **work** will be used to denote the design or piece of visual art being transferred.

The term **license** refers to the legal conditions under which the work is provided.

The term **public domain** denotes the absence of copyright and similar restrictions, whether by default or waiver of all such conditions.

The key words “must”, “must not”, “should”, and “may” in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

1\. Open Works
--------------

An open **work** _must_ satisfy the following requirements in its distribution:

### 1.1 Open License or Status

The **work** _must_ be in the **public domain** or provided under an open **license** (as defined in Section 2). Any additional terms accompanying the work (such as a terms of use, or patents held by the licensor) _must not_ contradict the work’s public domain status or terms of the license.

### 1.2 Access

The **work** _must_ be provided as a whole and at no more than a reasonable one-time reproduction cost, and _should_ be downloadable via the Internet without charge. Any additional information necessary for license compliance (such as names of contributors required for compliance with attribution requirements) _must_ also accompany the work.

### 1.3 Machine Readability

The **work** _must_ be provided in a form readily processable by a computer and where the individual elements of the work can be easily accessed and modified.

### 1.4 Open Format

The **work** _must_ be provided in an open format. An open format is one which places no restrictions, monetary or otherwise, upon its use and can be fully processed with at least one free/libre/open-source software tool.

2\. Open Licenses
-----------------

A **license** _should_ be compatible with other open licenses.

A **license** is open if its terms satisfy the following conditions:

### 2.1 Required Permissions

The **license** _must_ irrevocably permit (or allow) the following:

#### 2.1.1 Use

The **license** _must_ allow free use of the licensed work.

#### 2.1.2 Redistribution

The **license** _must_ allow redistribution of the licensed work, including sale, whether on its own or as part of a collection made from works from different sources, with condition of not redistributing in same or similar way.

#### 2.1.3 Modification

The **license** _must_ allow the creation of derivatives of the licensed work and allow the distribution of such derivatives under the same terms of the original licensed work.

#### 2.1.4 Separation

The **license** _must_ allow any part of the work to be freely used, distributed, or modified separately from any other part of the work or from any collection of works in which it was originally distributed. All parties who receive any distribution of any part of a work within the terms of the original license _should_ have the same rights as those that are granted in conjunction with the original work.

#### 2.1.5 Compilation

The **license** _must_ allow the licensed work to be distributed along with other distinct works without placing restrictions on these other works.

#### 2.1.6 Non-discrimination

The **license** _must not_ discriminate against any person or group.

#### 2.1.7 Propagation

The rights attached to the work _must_ apply to all to whom it is redistributed without the need to agree to any additional legal terms.

#### 2.1.8 Application to Any Purpose

The **license** _must_ allow use, redistribution, modification, and compilation for any purpose. The license _must not_ restrict anyone from making use of the work in a specific field of endeavor.

#### 2.1.9 No Charge

The **license** _must not_ impose any fee arrangement, royalty, or other compensation or monetary remuneration as part of its conditions.

### 2.2 Acceptable Conditions

The **license** _must not_ limit, make uncertain, or otherwise diminish the permissions required in Section 2.1 except by the following allowable conditions:

#### 2.2.1 Attribution

The **license** _may_ require distributions of the work to include attribution of contributors, rights holders, sponsors, and creators as long as any such prescriptions are not onerous.

#### 2.2.2 Integrity

The **license** _may_ require that modified versions of a licensed work carry a different name or version number from the original work or otherwise indicate what changes have been made.

#### 2.2.3 Share-alike

The **license** _may_ require distributions of the work to remain under the same license or a similar license.

#### 2.2.4 Notice

The **license** _may_ require retention of copyright notices and identification of the license.

#### 2.2.5 Source

The **license** _may_ require that anyone distributing the work provide recipients with access to the preferred form for making modifications.

#### 2.2.6 Technical Restriction Prohibition

The **license** _may_ require that distributions of the work remain free of any technical measures that would restrict the exercise of otherwise allowed rights.

#### 2.2.7 Non-aggression

The **license** _may_ require modifiers to grant the public additional permissions (for example, patent licenses) as required for exercise of the rights allowed by the license. The license may also condition permissions on not aggressing against licensees with respect to exercising any allowed right (again, for example, patent litigation).

_The Open Design was initially derived from the Open Source Definition, which in turn was derived from the original Debian Free Software Guidelines, and the Debian Social Contract of which they are a part, which were created by Bruce Perens and the Debian Developers. Bruce later used the same text in creating the Open Source Definition. This definition is substantially derivative of those documents and retains their essential principles. Richard Stallman was the first to push the ideals of software freedom which we continue._
